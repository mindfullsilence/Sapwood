# Sapwood

A [WordPress](wordpress.org) starter theme specifically designed for a component-based workflow
built off of the functionality provided by [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) and [Advanced Custom Fields](advancedcustomfields.com).

## Installation
In the terminal, cd to your theme directory, clone the project, run composer install and start coding.

## Usage

Information for usage will soon exist. I promise. Feel free to peruse the code and learn as you go. There are examples for templates and components in the public folder.


## Contributing

**Gitflow**

We use Gitflow as our branch management system. Please follow gitflow's guidelines while contributing.

**Pull Requests**

Please follow the repository's for all code and documentation.
All feature branches should be based on develop and have the format feature/branch_name.
Minor bug fixes, that is bug fixes that do not change, add, or remove any public API, should be based on master and have the format hotfix/branch_name.
All pull requests should implement a single feature or fix a single bug. Pull Requests that involve multiple changes (it is our discretion what precisely this means) will be rejected with a reason given.
All commits should separated into logical units, i.e. unrelated changes should be in different commits within a pull request.
